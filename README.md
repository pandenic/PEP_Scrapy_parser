# Scrapy parser

## Description
This application parses the PEP site using Scrapy spiders.
It returns the list of PEPs as "number", "name", "status", and a list where the quantity of PEPs at different statuses is calculated. It returns two .csv files.

To start parsing it should be written in the command line:
